                                to pursue my
                                acting career. Just kidding! I came here to do my
                                Master in Public Policy here at UC Irvine.

                                I studied developing and assessing policies, all of which have many
                                social impacts. There are many applications of policy making. Some that I have studied
                                range from Environmental impacts
                                of development projects (think traffic, removing native plants and animals), labor

                                I was studying Statistics where I would use data to assess the impacts of educational
                                programs like
                                free lunch programs. That led me to get a job with
                                an education e-learning company. My goal is to learn more about programming so I can
                                keep my options
                                open and so that in the future I can find a way of collaborating
